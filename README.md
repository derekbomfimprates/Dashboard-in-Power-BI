# Dashboard-in-Power-BI
A Power BI dashboard project that demonstrates advanced visualization techniques, including switch measures, scatter charts, treemaps, line charts, stacked waterfall charts, slicers, and connected tables. This dashboard showcases how to integrate multiple chart types and slicers for interactive data exploration and analysis.

## Overview
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard project that illustrates how to build an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using Power BI. It includes various chart types and techniques like:

- **Switch Measures**: Allows users to toggle between different measures for dynamic analysis.
- **Scatter Chart**: A graphical representation of data points in a 2D space to reveal relationships between variables.
- **Treemap Chart**: Hierarchical data visualization using nested rectangles, ideal for showing part-to-whole relationships.
- **Line Chart**: Displays trends and patterns over time, ideal for time-series data analysis.
- **Stacked Waterfall Chart**: Visualizes cumulative effects of sequential positive and negative values.
- **Slicers**: Interactive filters that help users dynamically slice and dice data.
- **Connected Tables**: Demonstrates relationships between data tables for deep insights.

The dashboard provides a cohesive view of key metrics with interactive features, offering users a hands-on experience with data-driven decision-making.

## Features

- **Dynamic Switch Measures**: Toggle between multiple KPIs or metrics for on-the-fly analysis.
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Includes scatter charts, treemaps, line charts, and waterfall charts to provide rich insights.
- **Slicers**: Interactive filters to drill down and explore specific data subsets.
- **Connected Data**: Relationship between multiple tables to support comprehensive analysis.
  
## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DashboardInPowerBI.git
    ```

2. Open the `.pbix` file using Power BI Desktop.

3. Connect the dataset and explore the dashboard's features, adjusting visualizations and slicers as needed.

## Usage

- **Switch Measures**: Utilize the toggle buttons or dropdowns to dynamically change the metrics displayed in the charts.
- **Slicers**: Use slicers to filter data across charts for deeper insights.
- **Charts**: 
  - **Scatter Chart**: Compare two variables and uncover trends or clusters in your data.
  - **Treemap**: Visualize the contribution of individual categories to the whole.
  - **Line Chart**: Analyze trends over time for your selected metrics.
  - **Stacked Waterfall Chart**: Track changes across different categories or time periods.
